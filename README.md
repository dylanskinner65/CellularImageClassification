## Explanation of the Data

One important thing to note is there are four different cell types. These types are HUVEC, RPE, HepG2, and U2OS, each defined as follows:

- HUVEC:
    - Stands for Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells.
    - These cells are derived from the endothelium of the human umbilical vein.
    - Endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels and play a crucial role in vascular function.
- RPE:
    - Stands for Retinal Pigment Epithelium.
    - RPE cells are located in the retina of the eye, and they have important functions related to supporting and maintaining the health of the adjacent photoreceptor cells.
- HepG2:
    - HepG2 cells are a human liver cancer cell line.
    - They are commonly used in research related to liver biology, drug metabolism, and toxicology.
- U2OS:
    - U2OS cells are a human osteosarcoma cell line.
    - They are often used as a model in cancer research and studies related to bone biology.
